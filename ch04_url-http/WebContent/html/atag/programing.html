	<h2>Programming</h2>
	<pre>It is called "programming" as a general term for the task of arranging the formulas and operations to be suitable for computers and rewriting them into computer-specific command codes, and writing the computer's command code is also referred to as "coding" in particular. Until the early 1950s when computers first appeared, programming was the use of command codes listing numbers. This is called machine language.
However, since it is difficult to work such as being easy to mistake in machine language and difficult to find the wrong place, after writing a program using symbols, languages, and expressions that are easy for human beings to memorize, It was devised a way to modify it and perform calculations from it. This is a way to increase the efficiency of your work by placing part of the work of creating the program on the <a href="computer.html">computer</a> itself.
